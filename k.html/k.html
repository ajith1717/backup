            <center><h4 class="h"> I created this web site with the help of HTML</h4>  </center>
            <p class="k">I created my first website by learning HTML, <br>1.HTML is defined as Hyper Text Markup Language,<br>2.HTML documents are described by HTML tags.<br>We use tags to markup the beginning and end of an element. Each element is written with an opening and a closing tag, with the content in between ,so the closing tag is just the same as the opening tag but with a slash. This is introduction about HTML </p>

            <marquee> 
            <h5 class="yellow"> HTML is amazing<br>I learned it after coming to Navgurukul so according to me Navgurukul is very amazing</h5>
